<ul class="faq">
    <li>How do I use the bookmarklet?</li>
    <li>Just add the link above to your bookmarks (using right-click), then click on the bookmark whenever you are in a Tiny Attack game. It does not auto-refresh, so you'll have to use it again if you want it updated.</li>
    <li>Is it safe?</li>
    <li>The bookmarklet has to run code in your browser. I did not do anything malicious, but you'll have to trust me.</li>
	<li>The numbers do not update properly!</li>
    <li>Everything that can still be undone (like building units) is not reflected in the numbers.</li>
    <li>What does 'STR' mean?</li>
    <li>'STR' is the current army strength, that is the sum of the cost of each unit, reduced proportionally for damaged units. Example: A Striker (which costs 200) with 6 health contributes a value of 120 to STR.</li>
    <li>What does 'POT' mean?</li>
    <li>'POT' is the army potential, that is the strength the army will have when all units are at full health.</li>
