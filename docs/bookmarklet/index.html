  <p>Then use the bookmark whenever you are in a Tiny Attack game.</p>
  <p>This does not need any plugin in your browser, but you have to use the bookmark manually every time.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p><strong>As a userscript</strong> (requires plugin)</p>
  <p>With a userscript, you can have the bookmarklet be applied automatically in all your games. In addition, it comes with an auto-update feature.</p>
  <p>First, you need to have a userscript plugin installed in your browser, for example Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, or Violentmonkey.</p>
  <p>Then you can install the bookmarklet: <a href="tabm.user.js">Install bookmarklet</a></p>
</li>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<ul class="faq">
    <li>What does 'STR' mean?</li>
    <li>'STR' is the current army strength, that is the sum of the cost of each unit, reduced proportionally for damaged units. Example: A Striker (which costs 200) with 6 health contributes a value of 120 to STR.</li>
    <li>What does 'POT' mean?</li>
    <li>'POT' is the army potential, that is the strength the army will have when all units are at full health.</li>
	<li>The numbers do not update properly!</li>
    <li>Everything that can still be undone (like building units) is not reflected in the numbers.</li>
    <li>Is it safe?</li>
    <li>The bookmarklet runs in your browser. I did not do anything malicious, but you'll have to trust me.</li>
